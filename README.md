## This is a React Web App I have built while taking an online course learning React with [@maxedapps](https://twitter.com/maxedapps?lang=en).

### Check the app out [here](https://udemy-burger-61040.web.app/).
### The Burger Builder app lets you build a burger with any amount of salad, cheese, meat, and bacon (how self-explanatory 🙄). You can also sign up and view your previous orders. It is also mobile-friendly!

Tools/technologies used:
- 🔥 Google Firebase (web hosting + realtime database)
- 🌐 [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (HTTP client)
- 🚀 [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) (state container for React)
